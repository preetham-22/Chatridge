- `lib/services/message_service.dart`
- `lib/theme/app_theme.dart`

### üîÑ M4: Broadcast Hub Firmware v1.0 - IN PROGRESS
**Goal**: Upgrade ESP32 firmware to full read-then-broadcast logic for multiple device support.

**Status**: üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- [x] Message protocol specification (MSG:, ALERT:, CMD:)
- [x] Message parsing and processing
- [x] Broadcast message functionality
- [x] Command handling system
- [ ] **TODO**: Multiple client connection management
- [ ] **TODO**: Client list management and tracking
- [ ] **TODO**: Connection event handling
- [ ] **TODO**: Message delivery confirmation

**Current Limitation**: ESP32 BluetoothSerial library supports only one active connection. Need to implement custom Bluetooth stack or use BLE with multiple characteristics.

**Next Steps**:
1. Research ESP32 Bluetooth Classic multiple connection libraries
2. Implement client connection pool management
3. Add message routing and delivery tracking
4. Test with multiple simultaneous connections

### ‚è≥ M5: End-to-End System Test - PENDING
**Goal**: Test complete system with two or more Android phones and one BlueBridge Hub.

**Status**: ‚è≥ PENDING M4 COMPLETION

**Test Plan**:
- [ ] Connect 3+ Android devices to single hub
- [ ] Verify message broadcasting to all connected devices
- [ ] Test message delivery within 2-second requirement
- [ ] Validate offline operation (WiFi/cellular disabled)
- [ ] Conduct 10-minute stability test
- [ ] Measure signal strength and range limits
- [ ] Test connection recovery scenarios

### ‚è≥ M6: Refinement & Polish - PENDING
**Goal**: Add error handling, connection status indicators, and polish UI.

**Status**: ‚è≥ PENDING M5 COMPLETION

**Enhancement Tasks**:
- [ ] Advanced error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Automatic connection recovery
- [ ] Message encryption (optional)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Battery usage optimization
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] User onboarding and tutorials
- [ ] Comprehensive testing suite

## Technical Debt & Known Issues

### High Priority
1. **Multiple Device Connections**: ESP32 BluetoothSerial limitation to single client
   - **Impact**: Prevents true multi-device hub functionality
   - **Solution**: Implement BLE-based solution or custom Bluetooth stack
   - **Timeline**: Critical for M4 completion

2. **Connection Recovery**: Automatic reconnection on signal loss
   - **Impact**: Poor user experience during connection drops
   - **Solution**: Implement background reconnection service
   - **Timeline**: Required for M6

### Medium Priority
1. **Message Encryption**: Currently uses Bluetooth pairing security only
   - **Impact**: Limited security for sensitive communications
   - **Solution**: Implement AES encryption layer
   - **Timeline**: Post-v1.0 enhancement

2. **Battery Optimization**: Continuous Bluetooth scanning affects battery life
   - **Impact**: Reduced device battery life during extended use
   - **Solution**: Implement smart scanning intervals
   - **Timeline**: M6 optimization phase

### Low Priority
1. **Large Message Support**: Current 512-byte message limit
   - **Impact**: Limits message content length
   - **Solution**: Implement message chunking protocol
   - **Timeline**: Future feature enhancement

2. **File Transfer**: No multimedia message support
   - **Impact**: Text-only communication
   - **Solution**: Add file transfer protocol
   - **Timeline**: Version 2.0 feature

## Success Criteria Verification
