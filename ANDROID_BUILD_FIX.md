# Android Build Fix Guide

## 🚨 Current Issue: Gradle Build Failure

**Error**: `Java home supplied is invalid` and missing `cmdline-tools`

## 🔧 **Quick Fixes (Choose One)**

### Option 1: Fix via Android Studio (Recommended)
1. **Open Android Studio**
2. **Go to**: Tools → SDK Manager → SDK Tools Tab
3. **Install**: ✅ Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest)
4. **Install**: ✅ Android SDK Build-Tools  
5. **Apply Changes** and restart

### Option 2: Fix via Flutter Doctor
```powershell
# After installing cmdline-tools in Android Studio:
flutter doctor --android-licenses
# Accept all licenses by typing 'y' for each prompt
```

### Option 3: Use Alternative Emulator
```powershell
# Try the other emulator available:
flutter emulators --launch Lomiri_Device
# Wait for boot, then:
flutter run -d emulator-5554
```

### Option 4: Use Physical Android Device
1. **Enable Developer Options** on Android device:
   - Settings → About Phone → Tap "Build Number" 7 times
2. **Enable USB Debugging**:
   - Settings → Developer Options → USB Debugging ✅
3. **Connect via USB** and run:
   ```powershell
   flutter devices
   # Should show your device, then:
   flutter run -d [your-device-id]
   ```

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting Steps**

### Step 1: Verify Java Installation
```powershell
java -version
# Should show Java 17 or later for Android builds
```

### Step 2: Check Android SDK Location
```powershell
flutter doctor -v
# Look for Android SDK path and verify it exists
```

### Step 3: Clean and Retry
```powershell
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d [device-id]
```

## 🎯 **Current Testing Strategy**

### ✅ **Phase 1: Web Testing (Active)**
- Testing UI/UX in Chrome browser
- Verifying visual design and navigation
- Checking non-Bluetooth functionality

### ⏳ **Phase 2: Android Testing (Next)**
- Once build issues resolved
- Full Bluetooth functionality testing
- Mobile-specific feature verification

### 📋 **Phase 3: Hardware Testing (Future)**
- ESP32 firmware flashing
- End-to-end system integration
- Multi-device communication testing

## 🚀 **Immediate Actions**

1. **Continue Web Testing** (current priority)
2. **Fix Android cmdline-tools** (background task)
3. **Prepare ESP32 hardware** (if available)
