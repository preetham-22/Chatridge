## 🔍 **Detailed Feature Testing**

### **Test 3: Chat Interface Deep Dive**
*Navigate to: `http://localhost:8080/#/bluebridge-chat`*

**Message Input Testing:**
- [ ] Type text in message input field
- [ ] Click send button
- [ ] Check message appears in chat
- [ ] Verify timestamp displays
- [ ] Test emoji/special characters

**UI Elements Testing:**
- [ ] Scroll functionality works
- [ ] Message bubbles display correctly
- [ ] Connection status indicator visible
- [ ] Settings/menu options accessible

### **Test 4: Device Discovery Testing**
*Navigate to: `http://localhost:8080/#/device-discovery`*

**Bluetooth Scanning:**
- [ ] Scan button is clickable
- [ ] Loading indicators appear
- [ ] Device list container shows
- [ ] Refresh functionality works
- [ ] Error handling for no devices found

**Expected Web Limitations:**
- Bluetooth scanning won't find real devices (web security)
- Should show "No devices found" or permission prompts
- UI should handle these gracefully

### **Test 5: Visual Design Testing**

**Responsive Design:**
- [ ] Resize browser window (small/large)
- [ ] Check mobile viewport (F12 → Device Toolbar)
- [ ] Verify text scaling
- [ ] Check button accessibility

**Theme and Branding:**
- [ ] BlueBridge logo displays correctly
- [ ] Blue color scheme consistent
- [ ] Typography (Google Fonts) loads
- [ ] Icons and graphics sharp

## 🛠 **Developer Console Testing**

### **Test 6: Technical Validation**
**Open Developer Tools (F12):**

**Console Tab:**
- [ ] No red error messages
- [ ] Bluetooth-related warnings (expected on web)
- [ ] Service worker messages (if any)

**Network Tab:**
- [ ] All assets load successfully (200 status)
- [ ] No failed requests (404/500 errors)
- [ ] Font files load correctly

**Application Tab:**
- [ ] Local Storage shows BlueBridge data
- [ ] Service Worker registered (if implemented)
- [ ] Cache storage functioning

## 📊 **Performance Testing**

### **Test 7: App Responsiveness**
- [ ] Click responses are immediate (<100ms)
- [ ] Smooth animations/transitions
- [ ] No lag during navigation
- [ ] Typing in message field is responsive

### **Test 8: Memory Usage**
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended use
- [ ] CPU usage stays reasonable
- [ ] No excessive network requests

---

## 🚨 **Error Scenario Testing**

### **Test 9: Edge Cases**
- [ ] What happens with very long messages?
- [ ] How does app handle network disconnection?
- [ ] Does app recover from temporary freezes?
- [ ] Behavior with browser back/forward buttons
